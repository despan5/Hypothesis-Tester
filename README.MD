# Overview

This is a statistical testing software that will take in large datasets from a csv file. This data will then be parsed and computed into a T test and Chi-Squared test.

I wrote this software to help statistics students and to learn the R language. The R language has many great benefits and uses, but it is hard to learn how to use it properly. This program has let me learn that process.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

This program was created within VSCode and meant to be run on there. It is possible to run it as a script through the terminal or within RStudio aswell. 

This also uses the dplyr library for data manipulation.

# Future Work

- More tests besides T test and Chi-Squared
- Accepts more file formats for versitility
- Graphical outputs of the tests
